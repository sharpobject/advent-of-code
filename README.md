# Advent of Code Challenges

The code for each is stored as `/year/challenge/code.lua`.  
For ease of checking, the challenge is provided as plaintext in `/year/challenge/challenge.txt`.  

If you wish to use this code, the runtime is [Luvit](https://luvit.io/install.html). Your challenge input should be in `/year/challenge/input.txt`.
